- **Jules by Google:** An experimental AI agent designed to automatically fix coding errors, assisting developers by addressing issues, modifying files, and preparing pull requests for Python and JavaScript tasks in GitHub workflows. citeturn0news16

**Considerations**

- **Accuracy:** AI models may not catch all issues or could produce false positives; human oversight remains essential.

- **Bias:** Ensure the training data is diverse to prevent the model from learning biased or suboptimal coding practices.

- **Security:** Be cautious of potential security risks associated with integrating AI tools into the development workflow.

By following this structured approach, organizations can develop an AI-driven automated code review system that enhances code quality, reduces manual review efforts, and accelerates the development process.
